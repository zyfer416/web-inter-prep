      "question": "What is the difference between '==' and '===' in JavaScript?",
      "answer": "The '==' operator performs type coercion and compares values after converting them to the same type, while '===' performs strict comparison without type coercion. For example: '5' == 5 returns true, but '5' === 5 returns false because one is a string and the other is a number.",
      "hints": "Think about type conversion. One operator converts types before comparison, the other doesn't.",

      "question": "Explain the concept of closures in JavaScript with an example.",
      "answer": "A closure is a function that has access to variables in its outer (enclosing) scope even after the outer function returns. Example:\n\nfunction outerFunction(x) {\n  return function innerFunction(y) {\n    return x + y;\n  };\n}\n\nconst addTen = outerFunction(10);\nconsole.log(addTen(5)); // 15\n\nThe inner function 'remembers' the value of x even after outerFunction has finished executing.",

      "answer": "The time complexity of searching in a balanced binary search tree is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes. This is because at each step, we eliminate half of the remaining nodes by comparing the target value with the current node and moving left or right accordingly.",

Use cases: function calls, undo operations, expression evaluation. Queue: FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure. Operations: enqueue (add to rear), dequeue (remove from front), front (view front). Use cases: task scheduling, breadth-first search, handling requests.",

      "answer": "Database indexing creates a separate structure that points to data in the main table, similar to a book's index. Benefits: Faster query performance (especially SELECT operations), improved WHERE, ORDER BY, and JOIN performance. Trade-offs: Additional storage space, slower INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations (index must be updated), maintenance overhead. Types: B-tree (most common), Hash, Bitmap, Partial indexes.",
